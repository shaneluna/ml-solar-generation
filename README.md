# Description

This is a python project aiming to analyze and predict solar power generation data.

# Getting Started

All code can be found in `main.ipynb` and all the cells have already been run if you'd just like to view things for reference.

If you'd like to modify and/or run any cells yourself, do the following:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Install the python module dependencies in your python enivornment.<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run jupyter lab (or open the `main.ipynb` in your IDE of choice).<br>
`jupyter lab`
4. You're all good to go to modify the notebook :)
